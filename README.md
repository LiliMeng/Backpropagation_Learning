# Backpropagation_Learning
Backpropagation learning using Java
Robocode Project Assignment1 from University of British Columbia EECE592 

implement a multi-layer perceptron and train it using the error-backpropagation algorithm. You will not yet need to use R
obocode, however you should keep in mind that your neural net will later be used in your robot tank. 
It will be useful if your neural network software is able to accept as a parameter the number of hidden neurons.
